# Keeps Clone

This app was made to learn React following Tutorials by Angela Yu. This app is the final learning stepping stone to making my personal portfolio website. This app is a clone of the Keeps app and is a functional frontend made using React. It incorporates important React concepts and development.

## To run locally

Clone repo

`npm start`

## Moving forward

Using what has been learned in this repo and the previous ones like the Secrets App, Todo-list and Daily Journal, I will be working on building my personal website. The personal website will be made using NextJS as the frontend with Node as the backend. Along with Ghost as a headless CMS running on the same server as the website.
